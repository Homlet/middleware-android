 * this ROUTER socket. Messages emitted from endpoints on this middleware pass through
 * individual DEALER sockets on ephemeral ports, which are created either when a message
 * is sent, or when a handshake message is received via the ROUTER. For more information
 * on the Harmony pattern, see the official ZeroMQ guide (chapter 8).
